# Happiness-Project ðŸ˜„
This repository containing all R scripts, data, and graphs for my semester-long visualization project on the causes and correlates of happiness in **POLS 40815**.

Over the course of three months, I gathered data from sources such as the World Values Survey and the General Social Survey to examine relationships between key variables and ultimately answer the question: *"What brings people happiness?"*

The project showcases my mastery of data visualization in R, leveraging packages like `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `plotly`, `rgl`, and more!

Thank you for checking out my project!
